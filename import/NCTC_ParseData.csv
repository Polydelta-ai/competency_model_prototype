Participants are not required to be highly skilled in mathematics or computing, although familiarity with spreadsheets and how the results of models can be applied is beneficial. Summary and Objectives: This is a fun, engaging, and challenging on-line course based on Dr. Anthony Starfield's Principles of Modeling for Conservation Planning and Analysis. Participants will learn about the modeling process, how to think like a modeler, and how modeling fits into management decision-making. Participants will develop practical skills on building and communicating about models. The class covers a variety of modeling techniques applicable to resource management and conservation issues. Session topics include Introduction to Modeling and Spreadsheets (e.g. context, sensitivity analysis, assumption analysis, and mechanics), Population Modeling, Decision Analysis, Ecosystem Modeling, Spatially Explicit Models, and the use of models in making conservation decisions. On-line presentations, discussion, and exercises emphasize hands-on experience with building spreadsheet models to illustrate the values, limitations, and appropriate applications of models. The typical weekly format consists of video lectures and spreadsheet modeling tutorial/exercise, homework on tutorial model, posting to a discussion board, and a virtual classroom meeting to debrief homework and present team model challenge results. The course schedule runs over a 15 week time span (with one week off). Instructors and coaches will have virtual office hours weekly. This course was developed in collaboration between the Bureau of Land Management, National Training Center, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Conservation Training Center, and the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. Course topics are similar to CSP3156a, except that participants work in teams on weekly modeling challenges. Weekly modeling challenges are questions within the context of natural resource management and require model building from the bottom up. Teams present their model results in weekly virtual classrooms. Modeling challenges require several hours per week more than those needed for successful completion of CSP3156a. Participants should be prepared to work an average of 10 - 15 hours per week.  Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to: Discover how to use models in planning for ecological and conservation biology decisions with defensible results. • Describe the modeling process, terminology, use of deterministic and stochastic models, what to leave out of a model, scale and resolution, • age or state structured models, and how to deal with uncertainty in making conservation decisions.

As long as you are on campus attending this 2 day course, it is suggested that you attend a second course as well.  Great leaders are able to recognize emotions as they arise in response to an action or situation. As a result, they are better able to address problems and handle any future complications. They also establish meaningful connections, allowing them to enhance and expand relationships which lead to better results. Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is an essential beginning to sustained, desired change for individuals, teams, organizations. This in-depth and experiential course based on the Six Seconds EQ © model will help increase your mastery of emotional intelligence to further develop your own leadership effectiveness as you gain new tools to apply immediately in the workplace. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize and regulate emotions in ourselves and others through three key elements: self-awareness, self- management, and self-direction.  Course Objectives: Using the Six Seconds © model, participants will: • Discuss and explore Self-Awareness as the foundational pursuit of EQ. Hands on, process oriented activity to further develop self-awareness and relate to your role as a leader. • Understand the neuroscience behind emotional intelligence and how to use the Six Second Pause © to shift out of reaction. • Enhance Emotional Literacy - engage in activities designed to expand on the concept that naming and claiming an emotion allows the brain and body to relax and deal with a challenging emotion. • Understand and demonstrate its impact on your work as a leader. • Recognize Patterns – discover and engage the reoccurring patterns of behavior that impact the choice of actions. • Discuss and explore self-management as the 2nd pursuit in the Six Seconds © model of EQ. • Apply Consequential Thinking - understand and apply consequential thinking by developing a series of powerful questions that relate to the emotional costs and benefits of a choice. • Intrinsic Motivation - develop awareness of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that drive us to make a variety of choices. • Navigate Emotions - learn to apply the Validate/Explore/Transform model of making a decision based on honoring and navigating your emotional landscape with awareness and clarity. • Exercise Optimism - learn and apply the model of optimism as presented by many researchers in the field. • Give Yourself - discuss and explore self-direction in the Six Seconds © model of EQ. • Increase Empathy - understand the concepts of empathy and engage with others to explore and practice empathic responses as a leader. • Pursue Noble Goals - increase a commitment to a vision of a purpose driven relationship with self and understand the benefits to the partners and staff that you work with.
